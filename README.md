A simple probe for a User Interface Design assignment.
## Background 
There are different types of probes that I can use to make observations, including cultural probes, design probes, technology probes, and provocative probes. Since the primary issue of this assignment revolves around the remote delivery of education, it is very clear to me that technology is a central aspect of our problem. Thus I have chosen to use a technology probe to help me acquire valuable insight. Technology probes are in the form of simple, flexible, and adaptable technologies. Examples of technology probes include mobile apps and websites. 

## Purpose
Every student at my university has had to take a course where assignments, quizzes, and even exams are delivered through a specific quiz format. This quiz format became commonplace among the university after the COVID pandemic had greatly affected the university's usual delivery of education. In order to identify potential improvements to the user interface of this quiz format, it is useful to make various observations. User interface designers use particular tools known as probes to make observations. These probes vary greatly in their nature, but the one I have chosed is a technological probe that mimics my university's common online quiz format.
